I put a group picture of my mom, dad, sister, and me. I put the summaries on the side of the photo. I tried to have the nav bar be a similar color to the background image on the webpage.
On the gallery I added Selfies of my sister, me, and my mom. I tried to have it have a similar color scheme to the homepage. I have a forms page that I labeled as Wishlist, so that they could fill it 
out the "wishlist" and submit it.
